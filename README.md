Please wait patiently and welcome FHAPD coming soon~~~

As for the comment about this:
The authors emphasized the proposed method could delineate APs at the large scale. However, the experiments in the manuscript are only based on the self-built dataset.
It is suggested that the authors add a completed AP delineation experiment in a large study area, like a country or a city.
I predict Northeast cropland plots based on Sentinel-2 in 2023. The data can be downloaded in Baidu Network and detailed download address is below:
